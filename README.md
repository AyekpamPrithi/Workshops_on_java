WORKSHOP ON JAVA

JAVA
This repository contains a simple Java project aimed at demonstrating fundamental programming concepts and best practices. Java is a high-level, object-oriented programming language known for its platform independence and robustness.

Key Features:-
Object-Oriented: Java follows the principles of object-oriented programming (OOP), making it modular, scalable, and easy to maintain.
Platform Independent: Code written in Java can run on any device or operating system with a Java Virtual Machine (JVM), ensuring cross-platform compatibility.
Robust and Secure: With strong memory management, automatic garbage collection, and a wide range of libraries, Java is known for its reliability and security.
Java Data Types
Java provides a wide range of data types to handle different kinds of data. Here's a quick overview of some basic data types in Java:

Data Type	Description	Example:-
int	Integer data type, holds whole numbers	int x = 10;
float	Floating-point data type, holds decimals	float y = 3.14;
char	Character data type, holds a single letter	char ch = 'A';
boolean	Boolean data type, holds true/false values	boolean flag = true;
String	Non-primitive, represents sequences of characters	String name = "Java";
Why Java?
Java is widely used in various domains, from web development to mobile applications and large enterprise systems. Learning Java opens up a wide range of opportunities in software development.
